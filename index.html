        The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkein was the first chapter book that Mini Me owned, I believe. Mr. Bookworm gave her a used
        copy
        that happened to match his original set. She was four years old, and she was delighted when he started to read her
        Daddy's book.
    
        Suffice it to say that The Lord of the Rings series is one of Mr. Bookworm's favorite series. And, of course, we
        watched
        each film as it released, except we only saw the first Hobbit movie in the theaters. (Um, twenty minute Disney-esque
        singing filler in the middle? The action was a bit slow, likely because the novel was made into three films. )
    
        First Lines/First Pages of The Fellowship of the Ring: this book is the first of the trilogy, though I know that The
        Hobbit takes place before LOTR, I decided to start with the trilogy. Of course, it may also help that The Fellowship
        of
        the Ring starts off in the exact same way that the films did and that was my very first introduction to Tolkein.
        (No, I
        haven't read the books....)
